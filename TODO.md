## TODO
- Read paper thoroughly on [information clustering from Nico](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Ji_Invariant_Information_Clustering_for_Unsupervised_Image_Classification_and_Segmentation_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf)
- Read paper from Guido on [unique information](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07487)

- Get MPI mail to work :)
- Where to eat? Quick run through the building?

## Thoughts so far
