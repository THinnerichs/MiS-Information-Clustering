- [Learning deep representations by mutual information estimation and maximization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.06670.pdf):
  - formalizes DIM, which simultaneously estimates and maximizes the mututal inforamtion between input data and learned high-level representations
  - uses adversarial learning to have desired statistical characteristics
  - can prioritize local and global information -> representations of segmentations much better than whole image
  - two measures of representation quality: 
    - Mutual Information Neural Estimation (MINE) (Belghazi et al., 2018)
    - Neural dependency measure (NDM) (based on Brakel & Benngio, 2017)
  - representation usable and suitable for many different classification tasks
  
- [On mutual inforamtion maximization for representations learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.13625.pdf)
